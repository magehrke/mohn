### Invariance
* invariance to local defor-mations
* Inaddition to being more biologically plausible, unsharedweights  allow  the  learning  of  more  invariances  otherthan translational invariances
* Going  beyond  such  simple  features  and  capturing  com-plex invariances is the topic of this work.
