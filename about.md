This website is a collection of personal notes regarding machine learning,
reinforcement learning, optimization and hyperparameter tuning. This website
is build automatically from my GitHub account using GitHub Pages and Forestry.
I use the repository exclusively for private purposise and as a way to collect
all my notes in one place. So basically: I will publish some of my work here.


I am German, 26 and study computer science and psychology.
