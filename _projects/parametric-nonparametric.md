### Definition
#### Bishop
The parametric approach focuses on the use of probability distributions having specific functional forms governed by a small number of parameters whose values are to be determined from a data set. An important limitation of this approach is that the chosen density might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can result in poor predictive performance.

Nonparametric approaches to density estimation make few assumptions about the form of the distribution.

#### Internet
Nonparametric methods: As the number of data points increases so do the number of model 'parameters' (restricting the shape of the function). Unlike a parametric model, where the number of parameters stay fixed with respect to the size of the data, in nonparametric models, the number of parameters grows with the number of data points.

### Parametric models
