# Terms

### Invariant:
* never changing
* a function, quantity, or property which remains unchanged when a specified transformation is applied

### Eigenvector
In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear
transformation is a non-zero vector that changes by only a scalar factor when
that linear transformation is applied to it.

Geometrically, an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue,
points in a direction that is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue
is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the
direction is reversed.

### LQR

### Lagrange Multiplier
First we have to understand that if we maximize an objective function subject
to a constraint, the maximum will be a point, where the objective function and
the constraint are tangent to each other for some value of x and y. This means,
that the objective function and the constraint have the same gradient direction
at this point.

So, the gradient of the objective function is equal to the gradient of the
constraint multiplied by some coefficient (which we call the lagrange
multiplier and which is usually denoted with lambda). We can actually use that
to find the Maximum.

Key take away: find the gradient of the one function, find the gradient of the
constraining function and then set them proportional to each other.

### NP:
Class of computational decision problems for which a given yes-solution can be verified as a solution in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine (or solvable by a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time).

### NP-hard:
Class of decision problems which are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Problems that are NP-hard do not have to be elements of NP; indeed, they may not even be decidable.

### Reminiscent:
* Tending to remind one of something (= erinnernd).
